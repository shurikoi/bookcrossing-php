# bookcrossing

## The purpose of the project

The goal of the BookCrossing site is to create a community where members can share and exchange their books. The main idea behind BookCrossing is to free up books by allowing them to travel and fall into the hands of new readers.

## Functions and features of the web application
### Functional requirements
- Creating a user database: The application should allow you to create a MySQL relational database that will store user data, such as logins, personal data, email and passwords. The tables in the database should contain the appropriate keys and data associations.

- Login/registration page: The application should contain a page where unregistered users will be informed about the need to log in or register. The page should contain a user login/registration form.

- Restricted access to the landing page: The landing page where information/news is displayed should only be accessible after logging in. Unlogged in users should not be able to access this page.

- Displaying information/news: After logging in, the user should be redirected to a page where information/news on any topic will be displayed. This information can be retrieved from a text file or from a database. The website should also allow you to add new information/news.
